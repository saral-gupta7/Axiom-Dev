# Security Principles

## Defense in Depth
Security should exist at:
- Network layer
- Application layer
- Data layer

Never rely on a single mechanism.

---

## Input Validation
- Never trust user input
- Validate early
- Sanitize outputs

---

## Common Vulnerabilities
- Injection attacks
- Broken authentication
- Misconfigured permissions
- Sensitive data exposure

---

## Rate Limiting
- Prevent abuse
- Protect availability
- Enforce fair usage

---

## Logging & Auditing
- Track security events
- Monitor anomalies
- Keep audit trails

Security is ongoing, not a one-time task.
