# Deployment & Release Engineering

## Environment Separation
- Development
- Staging
- Production

Never mix configurations.

---

## Configuration Management
- Environment variables
- Secrets management
- No hard-coded credentials

---

## CI/CD Pipelines
- Automated testing
- Automated builds
- Controlled releases

Manual deployments do not scale.

---

## Rollback Strategies
- Blue/green deployments
- Canary releases
- Versioned artifacts

Always plan for failure.

---

## Observability
- Logging
- Metrics
- Tracing

If you can’t observe it, you can’t debug it.
