# Performance & Scalability

## Performance vs Scalability
- Performance: speed at current load
- Scalability: ability to handle increased load

Optimize for both.

---

## Common Bottlenecks
- Database queries
- Network latency
- Blocking I/O
- Inefficient algorithms

---

## Caching Strategies
- In-memory caching
- HTTP caching
- Database query caching

Cache invalidation is hard—design carefully.

---

## Load Handling
- Horizontal scaling
- Load balancing
- Graceful degradation

---

## Monitoring Performance
- Latency
- Throughput
- Error rates
- Resource utilization

Measure before optimizing.
